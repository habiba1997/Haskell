The hello.hs file is the file that was defined in this module.

You need to have the Haskell Platform (http://www.haskell.org/platform/) installed to run the code.

Once the Haskell Platform is installed, you can load it into GHCi by either double clicking on the hello.hs file, or typing "ghci hello.hs" on a command line.
